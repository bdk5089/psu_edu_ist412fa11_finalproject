[SETUP]
This program is a stand-alone program that should execute without
any outside setup required.  The program will have to be run in 
a directory where a text file can be created, thus it cannot
be a read-only directory.

[Execution]
To execute the program you can run the following jar file:
\dist\IST412_WorldCampusTeam1_FinalProject.jar

[Ant Targets]
The following Ant targets are available:

clean:       Deletes the bin and dist directories so they can 
             be created again during the compile-all and build-all targets
             
compile:     Compiles the class files into the bin directory

compile-all: Compiles the class files and copies all other dependent files 
             from the src directory to the bin directory
             
build:       Creates the jar file after compiling the class files

build-all:   Creates the jar file from after compiling the class files 
             and copying other files from the src directory
             
build-ind:   Creates the jar file from the pre-compiled classes and files 
             contained in the bin directory
             
run:		 Runs the main program without compiling

run-all:	 Runs the main program after building the application

run-ind:	 Runs the main program from the already build jar file

doc: 		 Creates the javadocs in the docs folder

test-suite:  Runs the test suite "AllTests" class as it's own program
