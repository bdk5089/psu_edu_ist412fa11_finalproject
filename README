[SETUP]
This program is a stand-alone program that should execute without
any outside setup required.  The program will have to be run in 
a directory where a text file can be created, thus it cannot
be a read-only directory.

[Execution]
To execute the program you can run the following jar file:
\dist\IST412_WorldCampusTeam1_FinalProject.jar
